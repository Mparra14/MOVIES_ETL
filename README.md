# MOVIES_ETL
## Purpose:
In this project we were tasked by Amazing Prime to clean data to be used by others in order to find which movie with the lowest budget had the highest rating, in order to add it their platform. We were given a JSON file and two csv files to clean through using ETL. We were also able to come up with a block of code that would iterate through this data and create SQL tables for better visualization.
